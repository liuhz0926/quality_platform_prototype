I don't mean to sound like a troll , or a hater , but just a little disappointed at the moment . I paid 1 1/2 times the amount as i paid for my roku 3 over a year ago , and this thing ( the nexus player ) literally pales in comparison ( ATM )... but i guess i am betting on the future . A big part of the equation , for me anyway , is streaming my files from my computer .
8f14e45fceea167a5a36dedd4bea2543	no	Well as you all know the time has come where my dad has his series of scans starting tommorrow to find out if the pain in his back is cancer or not . And to see if it has spread anywhere else thoughout his body . Im soo terribly scared . I just dont think I can handle seeing him go through all the treatments again in fact i dont think he can handle it . Hes told me that he doesnt want to do it again . His last chemo was 6 months ago and now it might be starting all over again just when things seemed to be getting back to normal . I guess i always knew they werent normal i knew he still had cancer but its like i forgot about it you know ? in a way .. I coulld keep rambling about this and all my emotions and thoughts going through my head but Im not .. not for now anyway because i know you guys will help me though the outcome so until then PRAYER BELIEF AND AFFIRMATION will do . I just hope that I can post the outcome in the GOOD NEWS section I have always wanted to . =) anyhow prayers to you all ... thinking of this board always !
c9f0f895fb98ab9159f51fd0297e236d	no	It doesn't take high skill like you claim it does , you usually have set harass combos you tend to do and getting ganked in LoL isn't as difficult to survive as in DotA as the lanes are smaller , tower diving is harder and you have access to more wards . Not to mention smoke of deceit makes ganks even harder to survive in DotA , and you might easily find ganks set up in a way where one of the gankers is comming from behind the mid-lane tower , making escape a very hard thing to do .
45c48cce2e2d7fbdea1afc51c7c6ad26	yes	Guys , with the new concede option , all you gotta do is wait 5 minutes after the start of the match and you'll be able to bring up the concede vote . Please think sensibly , would you rather wait 5 minutes , or another 15 minutes or more for the next game ? Go and get a drink or something while waiting for those 5 minutes , geez ...
d3d9446802a44259755d38e6d163e820	no	No , not yet . She's scheduled to see her orthopaedic surgeon again tomorrow to check her progress - we're hoping he will say the bones are knitting and that she can start trying some weight-bearing physio . And then she'll see the chest surgery team beginning of next week . In an ideal world I guess they wouldn't operate until she's fit and well again , but it's likely to be at least another 4 months before they take the frame off her leg , and I can't see them leaving the cancer in situ that long - I don't know what rate it's growing at , but seems to me the sooner it comes out the better ! I've got the number for her chest team , so I was thinking of calling them directly and seeing what information I can get . She's quite bad at taking in all the details - or passing them on to us . I'd like to hear from the doctor how much lung she will lose and what the surgery will entail . Just need to work up some courage ...

e369853df766fa44e1ed0ff613f563bd	no	Dear Jojo , I know exactly how he feels . I was first given a cancer diagnosis in april 2012 and didnt recieve any ""treatment"" until september ( 2012 ), the best part of six months later . All I wanted was to get stuck into treatment but all I seemed to get was one biopsy or scan after the other then a final attempt at surgery before they finally set me off on chemo . Frustrating as it was I have to accept that the reason was to try to ascertain the ""precise and exact"" cancer they are going to treat . In my case , the cells from the tumour on my lung gave a ""medical indicator"" that it had originated , biologically , in my gut and my oncologist needed to be certain he was treating the primary cause rather than the secondary . So he spent some time with endoscopies and scans looking for something he never did find . However , if it had been there and he had missed it then things could have been far worse for me than the delay caused by the search for it . Be assured , there is no system based on ""how someone reports how they feel themselves"". I have hardly ever felt better in my life than I do now (or happier ), yet I am now on palliative programme with a terminal diagnosis . This is far from a logical illness but you and your father have my understanding and best wishes . Tones

67c6a1e7ce56d3d6fa748ab6d9af3fd7	no	I have had asthma for nearly 50 years . It drives me mad when people think you're 'just a bit short of breath' when you are struggling to breath at all . When I first married my husband he didn't understand asthma , as his mother used to have panic attacks and over breath . He seriously thought I was doing the same thing . It took about 4 trips to the hospital in an ambulance on oxygen till he finally realised it's actually a frightening experience , not being able to breathe . He has COPD now and a couple of times he has had it so bad that he was struggling to breathe , now I'm pretty sure he understands me .
642e92efb79421734881b53e1e1b18b6	yes	My heart goes out to you . Only you and your family can make the decision and as long as you have come to terms with it no one has the right to criticise you . I for one never judge anyone's decision on anything because this horrid disease effects each one of us so differently and throws up decisions that we have to make to suit us and no one else .

It also sounds as though the chemo is working , and that is a very good thing . I have non-small cell , but we have many members who , like you , have small cell and if you haven¬ít , you may want to check out the posts under ¬ìsmall cell¬î, as well as posts under the ¬ìgood news¬î tab . Please ask any questions you might have about treatments , side effects , etc . There are members here who most likely have been just where you are . I found the best thing I could do while going through treatment was to pace myself , getting plenty of rest , and drinking lots of fluid . Please come back often and let us know how you are doing .

7cbbc409ec990f19c78c75bd1e06f215	yes	My dad was given a break too when his scans revealed only a very small evidence of cancer in his left lung and and the two small lesions on his liver . I hated the fact that he wasn't getting chemo and that it might grow back double in 30 days . I was scared to say the least , but his body need a break and he had gotten so sick . The Dr . gave him another scan in 4 weeks and the cancer in his lung was GONE and the liver mets were very small . My dad got to enjoy a three 1/2 month break and recouperation period before his recurrence in March . Point is , you never know how a person is going to react to after treatment is over , or during a break , or if the chemo continues to work . Just consider what the Dr . is saying , and know that it can be beat if it is closely monitored . Second opinions could not hurt , then again , maybe her doctor could monitor with x-rays inbetween the ct scans like my dad was . I am SO HAPPY your moms results were SO GOOD ! I will continue to pray that they stay good and only get BETTER ! (( HUGS ))

She seemed un-interested and suggested that because im not eligible for a contactless card that i couldnt used apple pay so it was probably cancelled for this reason . My opinion is that Santander knew i was gaining weight at an unusual rate . Having used apple pay to buy a McDonalds they cut off my apple pay in a plea to stop me stuffing my face ... Ive been McDonalds free since . Thanks Santander üëå Id 972590626164875

26657d5ff9020d2abefe558796b99584	no	All the back catalog albums seem to be available if you search for them specifically in iTunes , but , for instance , the only 1970s album I see for Elton John if you look under his albums section under his artist heading in iTunes is ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road ."" On the iOS app , everything back to his debut album seems to be listed in his albums section . Am I looking in the wrong place in iTunes or something strange ?
e2ef524fbf3d9fe611d5a8e90fefdc9c	no	A bad and boring premier league season turned into a good first year with that win ! We all know how great a Mourinho team are in its second season . So , back in the big league . Challenging for the premier league . But next season will be defined by scoring goals ... Goals , will our players beat the goalkeeper ? One thing is certain . I will buy a shirt with number 7 before the season kicks off !
ed3d2c21991e3bef5e069713af9fa6ca	no	Item arrived the day before due delivery date . I have had this on my wish list for past year , hoping that the price would come down , it did , but not by much . This one was on offer ""as used and previously returned to Amazon"". I checked the parts details and the only difference was a replacement battery , the machine looked and behaved as new . A great saving from original price and allthough a bit apprehensive about using second hand , I recharged the battery and trimmed my hedge and other plants for about 30 minutes , what a bonus this is , it is quiet , a decent weight and well balanced for its size , but best of all no cables to get snagged or cut through . Its sawing action works a treat when required . I have a 175 foot long hedge to keep trim over the year , so hope that the li-ion battery is up for it . Very pleased with my purchase .

f899139df5e1059396431415e770c6dd	no	This is very quiet , sure and strong . It's a little awkward with the handle angle and caused small wrist fatigue after half hour constant use , but having a break at short intervals is sensible practice . Vibration is minimal and with a file i can see light sharpening is easy . Recently i have veered away from Bosch products as i have negative experience with other tools . This item restores my faith somewhat in Bosch , at least for the hedge trimmer it does . i would recommend this product over others as i have broken seven opther brands in the last six years . This is not very old yet , but already i can see it will last longer than them and it is around the same cost . I will post a review update in a year to confirm this

6974ce5ac660610b44d9b9fed0ff9548	yes	Hi Brian When I had my initial x-ray that led to the cancer diagnosis , the hospital emailed the x-ray to the GP surgery that same day and the surgery rang me to advise me that they had made an urgent appointment for me to see GP the next working day ( which was a Monday ). That was a fun weekend ! If the radiographer had seen something of concern in the x-ray the surgery would have been notified as a matter of urgency . Look at it as a positive that the surgery has not called you . To put your mind at rest , ring the surgery when it re-opens after the Christmas break and ask to speak to a GP . I know that waiting can be difficult but remember that worrying never changes anything . Stay off the ciggies and try to enjoy Christmas . x
c9e1074f5b3f9fc8ea15d152add07294	no	Thanks all for your comments I have taken it to Nissan this morning , who test drove it . They didnt say anything in particular , but look say everything . They say the tracking is still not right , as its still pulling to the left , and the wheel is nowhere near where it should be . I cant understand why the tracking , from never having been looked at , and the car driving perfectly stright , to being out every time its checked . As you have said , sounds very much like shoddy workmanship . I am going to write to ATS head office , to voice my complaints , dont really wish to take back to ATS , as dont trust them now !!. I will request the money back I paid ATS to sort the tracking , and foot the Nissan bill , as I dont think they would pay for this , unless I start mentioning trading standards Rgrds Chris

a0a080f42e6f13b3a2df133f073095dd	no	Hi Cicero ! Got a question ? Been going to my cardiologist after my ablation as I should . AVNRT is better . Guess it worked While DR was in with cath he checked my pressure #s ( as I asked he please do for me ). I'm like you with moderate PH . He found small ASD while there . While being seen by his Phys . asst for follow up she said something contradictory and has confused me evr since . I asked abt the ASD the DR had found and what will be done abt it .( the DR said it was small , no problem ). The PA had her trainee with her . The PA said as long as you have no problems with your heart's chamber filling there is no problem . I am fine she said . I said ""That would be me then , cause I do have a problem in that dept . I have left-sided heart failure or diastolic dysfunction ."" She just stopped and stammered and went to her file on me . Then next visit I saw the DR himself and told him what was said at that time . He said she should not have said what she did and that I am fine . I asked was she wrong then ? Your PA ? I do not remember what he said but the jest of it was all is well . I do not understand all this . I asked for the ASD size and no answer so far . Should I drop the worry here ? Thanks Cicero and everybody . Talk later ! piddler [ img ] marketing

I have known I have CHF since Aug . 2012 .( had bad symptoms of it for a while , but took a while to get diagnosed . Could the Chf have caused other issues ?

7ef605fc8dba5425d6965fbd4c8fbe1f	no	I was going for my golden shield , Combat Knife , Ballistic knife ( and crossbow ) to get the diamond camo . I've made at least 1000 kills combined with these weapons , and it's not only the knife , the shield is even worse , so many times i stood in front of a person , who i bashed with my shield , and you would hear the sound of me hitting him , even my character spins because it is following the person I wash bashing ( like aim assist or so ). But it didn ? t gave hitmarkers . Also with the ( ballistic knife ) I knife someone who is laying prone , capturing the B flag ( for example ) and I stand still , knifing him . The knife goes in him , blood comes out , but he doesn ? t die . Yesterday on raid , I had this 6 times before the guy finally died . But most of the time I die when I lunge and my knife is in his face , but he still somehow manages to kill me before he dies or so .
a8f15eda80c50adb0e71943adc8015cf	no	This app is very good at what it does but with a few more features it could be legendary . Features such as 1 ) Ability to process 'non-card' payments (or cash and cheques ) offline . This is very important if internet goes down . If you could at least take cash payments then upload when internet is better . 2 ) Ability to assign a bill to a table to be paid later . 3 ) The ability to add items to a saved bill . So in a coffee shop this would be ideal as it would allow for a table to add more items , order more food without having to try to keep that order in your head . There should also be some Sort of 'upgrade' discount for the new card readers , it's not fair that I spent ¬£99 on a card reader only to have a cheaper AND better one turn up a few months later .

0777d5c17d4066b82ab86dff8a46af6f	no	So I was on here a few months ago . In October of last year , I started to get some skipped heart beats . Because I had a large VSD and pfo as a baby that were repaired my local GP had an echo done . Echo showed mildly elevated pulmonary pressure of 'over 35'. I had a pft that showed increased airway resistance and Dlco that was just barely normal . So I went to a PH specialist , Dr . Shapiro at UCLA . She did a cardiopulmonary exercise test . She told me my gas exchanges were excellent and that she didn't think I had PH since I never desaturated , and my six minute walk test was almost 800 . She did tell me to buy a pulse oximeter since I have very occasional sob while relaxing or just randomly . I am fine with exercise , I jog two miles a day without getting too SOB . So I got the pulse ox and my saturations are almost always 98 or 99%. Sometimes while laying in bed before falling asleep it will randomly drop to 94 , then go back up to 98 . Not sure what it does after I fall asleep . The SOB I get feels like I have to take a very deep breath every few minutes , by lifting up my chest and taking a big sigh breath . It goes away with exercise . I would really just like a RHC , and I think Dr Shapiro will be willing to do one . I would like to stop guessing . I look at myself a bunch every day trying to decide if my lips look blue , if my feet look swollen . I'm driving myself nuts ! My pulse ox also dropped when I went hiking at 8000 ft elevation , but it only dropped for a minute . If I don't have PH I would love to have another baby , but I feel like I need to be certain before that happens . I have recently lost 60 lbs through hard work . Since then my blood pressure is pretty low and my heart rate is around 55 resting . I have been getting really dizzy when I stand up from laying down or sitting , and I'd like to believe its from the weight loss and lower blood pressure . Maybe there is something going on with my left heart too . I would just really like to rule out PH for sure since I know early treatment is crucial . For those of you who had the RHC , how long does it take to schedule one ? Should I get a hotel for the night since its a three hour drive ? I really hope Dr Shapiro is willing to do one soon . I'm tried of wondering if the breathing thing and dizziness are anxiety or PH . (
fa7cdfad1a5aaf8370ebeda47a1ff1c3	no	Ive been to platinum suites many times . We showed up 15 minutes before the movie and were told to take a seat in the lounge . After waiting about 10 minutes I found a waitress to try and make an order for popcorn , coke light and a caesar salad . The next waitress just told us to go to the theatre and order from there . %0A%0AIT took a very long time to make our order . My salad came within 10 minutes of ordering , but the popcorn and coke light my wife ordered took over 30 MINUTES ! Its popcorn and a coke light !

a4a042cf4fd6bfb47701cbc8a1653ada	yes	After I posted I thought more about what you asked . I was in an almost euphoric state the past couple days - but yes , it's wearing off some now . I do remember the first time I started Humira that it took a good 3 months for it to kick in . Might very well be somewhat of a placebo effect going on ... But back on track to your question - I remember when I stopped getting the Humira I then had no biologic for 3 months . I didn't have any side effects from that , but I did notice the overall effect of the Humira wore off very slowly . I attribute that to these meds being very slow acting in the first place . I thought if it took 3 months for me to feel any positive effect in the beginning , it may well take 3 months for that effect to wear off . Your breathing problem would be a concern for me . Maybe worth a visit to your PCP in the meantime to get it checked out ? Possibly an infection of some sort not directly related to the Enbrel ? This would be the time for an anti-biotic to knock it out in between the biologics .

a597e50502f5ff68e3e25b9114205d4a	yes	I want to reccommend a couple of things to you . The first , is that I want you to know that we have one of the top ten cancer hospitals in the United States right here in Chicago ! The University of Chicago Hospitals' and the Center for Advanced Medicine are ranked 6th best in cancer by US News and World Reports annual rankings of America's bes hospitals . they have oncologists there that work together in teams , and are experts in lung cancer . Dr . Charles Rudin MD PhD specializes in small cell , and there is all kinds of research going on there . Even though you live in the suburbs , TRAVEL ! Trust me it is worth it ! The care is so superb and on the cutting edge there ! If you do not believe me go to and order your free cancer video and learn about how they treat cancer . You seem to be in the early stages and you seem to uusually have some resistance to it because it went and stayed into remission for so unusually long . I want you to have the best shot ! If you ever want to talk , call me after 9pm , at ( 773 ) 817 2494 . I live in the Bridgeport area , ( near Comisky park ) around 35th street , and I am a premed student that is going to go into oncology . See , my mom died of this disease , and i am dedicated to helping others to beat it ! By the way , the other thing i wanted to tell you about is a drug called CPT-11 ( irrenotecan ) which is a new drug that is showing dramatic results in sall cell patients . Please call me or email me at te11t@aol . com I would love to help you . Jonathan

85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954	no	Hi so I'm applying to Pembroke for physical natural sciences . I was just wondering if anyone who applied last year or is a student could tell me how the interviews work . Are the interviews subject specific ie a maths interview separate to a chemistry interview or subjects mixed together ? If separated would I get to choose which two out of chemistry , physics and maths I would like interviews in ? Do they give source material/ something to read or anything before interview ? Is there normally one interviewer or multiple ? Thanks to anyone who offers any advice

I can't just vent privatelysomething about another person responding helps . I thank you for your words just woke up so getting this in before I feel worse . Over the 33 years I have occasionally told my husband I was not speaking to him anymore . He always laughs and says that is not possible for you . After coming out of my coma I was still on the respirator for several days and it is policy for patients on that in ICU to have their hands tied down I could not communicate I was too weak touse a pencil anyway afterwards he told me he was afraid I would explode from not getting my point across . The point of this it does not seem possible to do short sentence and maybe make u smile . Thank you so much . Tj

eae27d77ca20db309e056e3d2dcd7d69	no	but the deal here is effciency . Yes the diesel does produce more pollutants , but what would you rather have . A Car that gets 30 mpg on average , or a car that gets regularly well into the mid 40's . Even close to 50 if you push it gently ? Even with increased pollutants when you run the miles down , it's still not a bad deal .

1534b76d325a8f591b52d302e7181331	no	One of the things I've learned about PH is that each patient is unique . Some results in some people are affected by sedation and some are not . What is standard is the RHC techniques and drug challenges used by qualified PH docs . It's a guess whether the Echos and the previous RHC were done correctly or whether they were misread . What matters is what is happening now . You owe it to yourself to see an expert . As an aside , before I got a proper exercise RHC , I was misdiagnosed by two different well known PH specialist docs ( both pulmonary docs ) listed on the PH site . One of them no longer does caths , and the other was on vacation during my cath and had a doc do the cath who only worked in the cath lab . Results were wrong both times and I was referred to a cardiologist who didn't question the findings or my symptoms . I was mistreated for three years for a heart problem I didn't have . Thankfully I found Dr . Daniels !

63dc7ed1010d3c3b8269faf0ba7491d4	no	I will definitely join this challenge . My nape has gotten better now that I treat it separately from all of my hair . It's a different texture completely from the rest of my hair . I usually wear a half up half down hairstyle which leaves my nape exposed but I do my best to baby that area especially during my deep conditioning treatments . I moisturize my hair every two or three days with extra attention to the nape area .

555d6702c950ecb729a966504af0a635	no	Rogue employee sounds like Joseph Jett , Nick Leeson , Jerome Kerviel ... it's always a ""rogue"", somehow . You'd think the companies would be embarrassed by recycling the stale old story by now . When profits roll in and the stock prices rise following trends , then management ""deserves"" outlandish compensation for their massive ""responsibilities"". But when it is time to take responsibility for actions , curiously it's always down to a ""rogue"" and there was nothing , nothing , absolutely nothing , that management could have done - poor them .

918317b57931b6b7a7d29490fe5ec9f9	no	Hi everyone , I am new to PAH . Can you tell me what to expect , or what to do now before things get worse ? My pressure is 30 so I am not severe yet . However , if there is something I should or could do now to make life easier later on , I'd be interested in hearing it . I work 40 hours a week but it is a sit-down job . I am a nurse and don't feel able to do floor nursing anymore . Just making a meal at home leaves me weak and shaking and breathless . I also have high pressure in the left side of my heart which my cardiologist states is a strange combination . Do any of you have that also ? smhoover6 Posted on 07/14/13 , 0634 pm

eddea82ad2755b24c4e168c5fc2ebd40	no	i use 2 black hats on my anti air class with the stinger . the black hats take slightly longer to lock on , but it means i can take down a lodestar on my own ( 2 rockets , 1 PDA ). combined with engineer theyre useful for destroying guardians and sentry's from behind walls , especially in objective type games emp's were useful in mw3 but i think theyre outclassed by black hats in bo2 . killing an enemy with their own betty or shock charge is funny . the black hats also dont show up on your silohuette like a launcher does . you can run 1 on all your classes as an anti air supplement if you rarely use tacticals anyway the other tactical grenades ( flash , stun ) also give 50 assist points , and they more effectively disable opponents

The ratings are as follows but at those prices , you'll be getting what you pay for . API = American Petroleum Institute S = Service - Petrol Engine Performance C = Commercisl - Diesel Engine Performance PETROL SG - Introduced 1989 has much more active dispersant to combat black sludge . SH - Introduced 1993 has same engine tests as SG , but includes phosphorus limit 0 . 12%, together with control of foam , volatility and shear stability . SJ - Introduced 1996 has the same engine tests as SG/SH , but phosphorus limit 0 . 10% together with variation on volatility limits SL - Introduced 2001 , all new engine tests reflective of modern engine designs meeting current emmissions standards DIESEL CD - Introduced 1955 , international standard for turbo diesel engine oils for many years , uses single cylinder test engine only CE - Introduced 1984 , improved control of oil consumption , oil thickening , piston deposits an wear , uses additional multi cylinder test engines CF4 - Introduced 1990 , further improvements in control of oil consumption and piston deposits , uses low emmission test engine CF - Introduced 1994 , modernised version of CD , reverts to single cylinder low emission test engine . Intended for certain indirect injection engines CF2 - Introduced 1994 , defines effective control of cylinder deposits and ring face scuffing , intended for 2 stroke diesel engines CG4 - Introduced 1994 , development of CF4 giving improved control of piston deposits , wear , oxidation stability and soot entrainment . Uses low sulphur diesel fuel in engine tests CH4 - Introduced 1998 , development of CG4 , giving further improvements in control of soot related wear and piston deposits , uses more comprehensive engine test program to include low and high sulphur fuelsSG - Introduced 1989 has much more active dispersant to combat black sludge . ACEA Specifications ( Association des Constructeurs Europeens d ? Automobiles ) ACEA ratings are prefixed with ? A ? for petrol , ? B ? for light or passenger car diesel and ? E ? for heavy duty diesel . The current specifications are A1 Fuel economy petrol A2 Standard performance level A3 High performance and/or extended drain A4 Reserved for future use in certain direct injection engines A5 Combines A1 fuel economy with A3 performance B1 Fuel economy diesel B2 Standard performance level B3 High performance and/or extended drain B4 For direct injection car diesel engines B5 Combines B1 fuel economy with B3/B4 performance E1 Non-turbocharged light duty diesel engines E2 Standard performance level E3 High performance and extended drain E4 Higher performance and longer extended drain E5 High performance and long drain plus API performances Cheers Simon
cd00692c3bfe59267d5ecfac5310286c	no	I'm definitely seeing new growth , an inch or two , so a couple months of growth corresponding to when I started . My hair is noticeably thicker at the crown , a really ackward phase until I get a few more inches . My scalp rotates from really clean and happy to waxy and flaky . I was getting pretty flaky so I put acv straight on my scalp for two days straight and rinsed longer than usual both days and that seemed to clear thing up . My sebum on my lengths is not as good but it will come back . I need to do some serious s&d , it has been 5 months since my last professional trim ( I bought scissors and been having lots of fun microtrimming once a month . Last month I even took the terrifYing step of trimming a half inch off the thinest part of my hemline . I'm really pleased with self cutting

6da37dd3139aa4d9aa55b8d237ec5d4a	yes	Hi Omega ; Nobody really knows for sure when someone¬ís time will be up . There is so much out there now to help patients with cancer that I feel it is difficult to see a timeline . Some people are more apt to give up with a time frame or depress them more . On the other hand , it seems fair a person should know . This one will be between you and the family I suppose . We are still dealing with that one . I do agree that some patients can handle being told a timeline , but some cannot . How that is determined , I do not yet know . To read a timeline is worse than the doctor telling it . Careful what you read and where you read . Getting additional opinions is excellent . I am not so sure you should be considering what treatments but see what the options are for treatment . Let them inform you . There are a number of Stage 4 patients , and my husband is currently one , that get palliative care . It won¬ít cure it but it can prolong it . Some don¬ít go for a long time but others pull extra years . There will be various choices . I have a niece going into a third year . I think it was kind of explained to us that the treatments are good if the quantity of qualify life is met . The patient decides if X number of days a week is worth whatever the reactions are to the meds . My husband , I think , will do better now that the radiation is over . If you keep reading here , you will see that . I may be wrong but I always thought Stage 4 was never surgery . They can explain this to you . If you want to read , do some reading here . I found this very helpful to me . I think you are on the right track . My husband had same lung cancer and after very aggressive radiation and chemo , it was successful enough that they were able to remove his two lower lobes of his right lung . He was Stage 3B then . All was fine until this past October and it is back and now he is Stage 4 . The link in my sig tells about his journey . It is a little long but you could glance over it . It was a tough road for him but he made . They couldn¬ít radiate his lungs again but they did his spine this time and chemo for the lungs . Fortunately the recent PetScan shows things improved but still one lymph node lights up and some very small ones that questionable even if they are cancer . They are continuing with more chemo . For what it is it is good . At some point , you might find that you will want to salvage all the good times you can with Dad while he is feeling well . I did that today with my husband . Next week he may not feel so good . It is not an easy road but coming here can be encouraging . Don¬ít forget about this part . Time together . Now you have a couple points of view . Amounts to the same in different words . I ramble on . PBJ is so good with words . I will have your Dad in my thoughts and prayers . Keep us posted . Remember , second is good to get , if even just for your own piece of mind .

40008b9a5380fcacce3976bf7c08af5b	no	@AndresRGarcia A monopoly is defined in different jurisdictions differently ( usually someone who has 70-100% of the market ). A monopoly is governed by different rules than non-monopoly companies . Apple and iOS are NOT monopolies , and therefore they don't follow the same rules as Google and Android . In the United States , Apple is 40/60 with Google . So , neither is a monopoly in the United States . In other countries it's 20/80 , so Google is .

This is the second time someone has subcribed to a private list . I had public lists ( before they made private possible ), but then put some to private . I had 0 subscribers to it . Months later ( 2 days ago ) someone subscribed to my private list . Just sucks because I added tons of songs to it . Nobody , but search engines have my link . / Now I don't know which ones are truly private . Please make playlist private even if someone has a link . I guess this will only affect people that used the service before they created private lists .

05049e90fa4f5039a8cadc6acbb4b2cc	no	About a month ago Mum got told the tarceva had stopped working and her lung cancer is worsening . She chose to have a few weeks off treatment to hopefully have a short break away and celebrate her birthday . At that point Mum was mobile and relatively ok . These last 2 to 3 weeks have seen a rapid change . She has become extremely anxious and increasingly breathless . We found out on Friday that her SATS were low , which could have been adding to her anxiety and agitation . So with SATS of 83% Mum got took into hospital to see if there was increasing fluid around her heart and/ or a chest infection . Both have now been ruled out so it looks like its the cancer winning . We are hoping Mum will be discharged tomorrow on oxygen , nebulisers and morphine . Nobody has told us what to expect and its so scary . Fear of the unknown on top of knowing i am losing my Mum and best friend is horrendous . She is quite weak now and not very mobile at all . With her breathlessnes and struggling to take good breaths will Mum get increasingly tired ? I just hope we can make her peaceful .
cf004fdc76fa1a4f25f62e0eb5261ca3	no	Living in excruciating pain since 1998 all day , every single day of each year from OA & RA in both ankles and knees without any pain meds ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èüòß Being in my 40's & feeling like my body is twice that age . Desperately wanting to exercise and only being able to make it to my bed at the end of each work day . Putting on a smile to attempt to hide the pain . Always tired , not sleeping thru the night due to the stiffening of my joints and the toil this debilitating disease has on my body daily . Getting out of bed and dreading the first two steps I take to start my day . Unfortunately , my challenges can go on and on , so I'll just stop here and send up prayers to God for everyone's healing ; in the name of Jesus‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èüôèüôèüòáüòá

d709f38ef758b5066ef31b18039b8ce5	no	See that's the thing . All verification would be done at a state or local level , which seems like a nightmare to sort through . So while it could be done , it seems like it would be pretty onerous to implement . And I guess they could devise a specific test for these cars , but again , not sure how it would be implemented nationally . And these cars are all designed to pass in the first place , so it would have to be something that checks the software ? CARB , which is leading the charge , only requires testing every 2 years . And new cars get a 6 year exemption , no testing required , just a fee . Not sure how they would be able to check a 2012 vehicle ...

ffd52f3c7e12435a724a8f30fddadd9c	no	Sorry , this is really long but I have to get it off my chest My Dad was diagnosed with nsclc a year ago . He underwent chemo & radio and was told at his 12 month check-up that he had another tumor in his lung which was eating into his rib . He reported his headaches & sickness at this point which we had all put down to stress . Consultant said she wanted to rule out anything untoward in his head , so referred him for scans & second round of radio . Week before his radio started I rang him to see how he was & he seemed to be slurring ; Dad's not one to fuss and only when I pushed him he said he thought he might have had a mini stroke ! Frantically got him a Dr appointment who diagnosed Bell's Palsy due to a numbness in his tongue . He was admitted to University Hospital North Durham for tests & obs . Biggest joke is , I came up from my home in Leicester for that week to take him for his radio at the Freeman in Newcastle- I had to pick him up from hospital in Durham , take him for treatment at Newcastle & deliver him back to Durham - all because they couldn't get transport sorted ! 3 hour round trips for a week ! While he was in hospital he had a CT scan , the lung function nurse gave him the results of this as ""all clear - nothing on his brain"" On the last day of his treatment , whilst he was away from the ward in Durham , a porter came to take him for his MRI scan and couldn't as Dad was in Newcastle having radio . Consultant came in afternoon and was visibly pi**ed off at Dad having missed the scan , so discharged him ""as he may as well wait for an appointment as an outpatient"". 5 weeks later and Dad has MRI scan , still no follow up appointment for the results . After ringing the Consultants secretary for over a week , I manage to blag an appointment for Sept 7th . Sept 7th comes , we are told that cancer has spread to Dad's head and is pressing on the Hypoglossal nerve which has caused his tongue to go numb . surgery is not an option due to the risk it carries and the fact that the disease is so aggressive , if they remove the tumor , another is likely to grow in it's place . Chemo can't be given and radio not possible due to the damage it may cause to the surrounding nerves ... Dad asks how long and is told 3mth - 3 year . Consultant thinks Dad shouldn't be getting headaches from the tumor and wants him to have a lumber puncture to test the meningal fluid . ( methinks there may be more tumors up there now ). By now , Dad is hardly eating , at 18stoone Dad not eating is unusual to say the least . Lung Function nurse tells consultant ( yes , TELLS ) to try anti-sickness drugs and not to admit Dad . We leave hospital with script for anti-sickness drugs & told mac nurse will bring morphine . 8th Sept- Dad still vomitting & headache worse than ever . I chase up lung function nurse , she will make sure referrals are done 9th Sept- see above . I call Dad's GP and tell him he needs something for pain , GP calls Dad to say script ready for morphine . 10th Sept - hurrah ! Dad is no longer in pain ! This is the very short version of what has happened . I have quit my job in Leicester , got my flat up for rent to move home at 38 to look after him & Mam who has severe heart failure . I have had to fight EVERY STEP OF THE WAY to get Dad seen & treated . Dad thinks it's because he's 60 and on the scrap heap they aren't bothered and I have to say that despite disagreeing with him face to face , I agree totally . I know he is dying and they can't stop that , but the NHS and their treatment of my Dad ( don't get me started on Mam's experience ) is a disgrace . I know that staff working in the NHS are doing a tough job and are incredible for the most part , but I am so disappointed that I had to air my thoughts with someone other than my fantastic family & friends . PS - any stories on the mts to the brain would be useful . Shelle

f61d6947467ccd3aa5af24db320235dd	no	I ran one as a daily driver for 6 years and in that time put 1/4 million miles on it ! It was at the time the highest mileage 4 . 2 V8 that the local dealer had seen . It eventually dropped a cog in the gearbox ( auto ) and cost ¬£2K to put right in order to flog it ( it was touch and go if there was better value in breaking it ) but in that time apart from lots of brake pads , discs , coil packs , a couple of aux' radiators and a mortgage worth of fuel it was as good as gold and the most delightful place to spend hours of my day . I started off using 98 all the time and then once it got up near ¬£1 . 50/litre I went to 95 and never even noticed the difference .

00ec53c4682d36f5c4359f4ae7bd7ba1	no	I know I've written on here already , but I thought I would add this , my daughter was 18mths old when she was diagnosed ( usually they don't diagnose until 2yrs , but strong family link ) I remember her in the car seat as an 18mth baby alright one min not the next , so foot down to a/e which was couple of mins away , luckily she was ok , but a frightening moment and a few after that , scary a couple of yrs ago too , now an adult but what she was presenting sounded like me , we're both asthmatics but I also suffer with spontaneous pneumothorax , and my daughter had a mucus block in her lungs which also stops your lung from working , she was in resus and again luckily pulled through , also when my youngest when 3 wks old he wasn't feeding properly and looked like he had difficulty because of breathing , I asked an out of hrs dr was it bronchiolitis ( as another baby that was in contact with my older children was in hospital a few weeks before with it , then my daughter caught a cough and cold , w ...

It's turned out thankfully to be inflammation and have to have another CT scan to see if it's gone but it seems you can go about exercising etc and not even know it's there apart from tiredness and having to use the blue inhaler all the time which isn't really unusual for me anyway . Really not sure where to go with this I've never smoked and have been a runner and exercise instructor for 32 year's and feel like a 60 a day smoker !!!!

They said head was clear but he has started getting lots if headaches and his speech intermittently is slurred . He also loses his footing now and again and has slipped over . Does anyone know if mets to brain happens quickly ? As it didn't show up in October . He is not having a CT scan on lungs till April because he had so much work done internally the surgeon said they wouldn't be able to see anything . D
f4f6dce2f3a0f9dada0c2b5b66452017	yes	My wife is also taking Chemo and experiences severe general body pain and bone pain after the second day and it lasts for 2 , 3 , or 4 days . She takes Oxycontin 10 mg and Oxy IR 5 mg to control the pain . The Onocologist has told us she can take 20 mg oxycotin every 12 hrs and the oxy IR , up to 15 mgs every 2 hrs . The key here is to prevent pain , if it starts you chase it to control it . CAUTION , ASK HER ONOCOLOGIST WHAT DOSE SHE CAN TAKE , different meds may work better for her . In addition , this is the hardest to say , She must have the desire to fight , its her battle .

9b70e8fe62e40c570a322f1b0b659098	no	Hi All , just wanted to give you a quick update on what's going on in here . My Mother in law agreed to have a second opinion and we are now scheduled to have a meeting in a private cancer center in Milan next week . At the same time I was able to have a look at her medical chart . She was told from her doctors that SCLC ""has grown a bit"" while for what I have read it is stated ""PD - which stands for progressive disease- +25%, + a new 1 mm hypodense liver lesion + hepatomegaly- The doctor wrote already in April when chemo was prescribed that it was palliative even if the cancer was considered LD She is now thinking about moving to our house , as her family ( husband and 2 daughters ) is very protective , but at the same time she doesn't have anybody helping her at home ( she still have to cook for them all and to take care for everything at home ) and she needs to rest as much as she can . I know exactly what expects us if she is moving . Years ago I used to work as a voluteer in an hospice , but this is not exactly the same . It makes such a big difference when someone you love gets involved ... So , let's wait for the scheduled meeting with the new doc . I really don't know how she will react if he will be outspoken and tell her all the truth but to me she has the right to know everything .

Over two years of traipsing to the doctors and back . Very quickly diagnosed with depression , took all of 5 minutes to come up with this , after all what else could cause fatigue ? Repeated visits to the doctor just reinforced his opinion and said that I was now showing characteristics of anxiety . Just up the dose of sedating meds was the answer . Now diagnosed with sclc , but the two years of depression/anxiety and accompanying fatigue/non specific symptoms is not related to the diagnosis of cancer says the doctor . Should I believe him ? Ray
f1b6f2857fb6d44dd73c7041e0aa0f19	yes	Its really not the same for any one person . Some people are taken too soon , while others are living and functioning as close to normal as possible , and can do so for decades . There is no 'typical' path . Create your own !
68ce199ec2c5517597ce0a4d89620f55	no	it's so stupid how a lot of these pro players do this fancy jumping around with knife out . like what's the point , it's just more of an opportunity for the other team to get you off guard .Ôªø

ef575e8837d065a1683c022d2077d342	no	I've worked a number of places where the reqs were communicated verbally , no written docs . Or at least some of the reqs . But something like this ? There is an email or other document where somebody told an engineer to do this . If not , then the s/w engineers are fools or idiots . There is no way I would ever put such code into a product , and if I did it would only be with some kind of document with a signature . This CEO is setting himself up to look like either an idiot or a villain trying to cover up for his bosses/colleagues by saying this . Some s/w engineer is going to present evidence to the contrary , or the investigation is going to find a whistle-blower . This is typical though - the bosses want something unethical or stupid done , and then they lay the blame on their underlings .
2050e03ca119580f74cca14cc6e97462	no	I don't believe the Co-Star has an IR receiver . That's the reason I elected to just get another Revue instead .

d18f655c3fce66ca401d5f38b48c89af	yes	Hi Charl , Sorry you find yourself here ( Radiotherapy now wll only relieve symptoms for her , it won't prolong her life sadly . It's good she is home and has the equipment she needs and really good she has been out and about . We too had the same thoughts , well what will kill dad as he is all there , sat up eating and feels well . In the end an infection took my dad and it was very quickly , less than 12 hours ... I believe that what I know about cancer , cancer doesn't hurt and it doesn't kill , but it presses on things causing pain and damage and stops the function of organs and that is what causes someone with cancer to die . Keep an eye on your mum's breathing , her pulse and her temperature . If you find that her breathing becomes rattling then call your district nurse or macmillian nurse . But unless she has a temperature or displays worrying signs ( and you will know ) then try and enjoy her and make lots of new memories . Take care and keep in touch xx

218a0aefd1d1a4be65601cc6ddc1520e	no	I'm trying really hard to give this a shot over my beloved Spotify , but it's not making it easy for me . I created a bunch of new playlists ( in the app ) and have tried adding songs to them . When I click to add the song to the playlist , it says it has been added . Then when I hit done or otherwise go back to the playlist , the song disappears . I have been playing with this new service for an hour now and still have nothing but a bunch of empty playlists . Not fun . I have seen through google searches that others are having the same problem , but no one seems to have an explanation or solution .

559cb990c9dffd8675f6bc2186971dc2	no	I use ECP and SKS . SKS usually wins on price but ECP wins on service , quick delivery and a local ( ish ) branch makes life easier if there's a problem . I find the guys on the counter @ ECP helpful as well . SKS good price but longer delivery , often stuff takes ages and seems to come directly from the manufacturer . A bigger range available . ECP usually requires a discount code for the best price . Range not so good but quick delivery . GSF aren't always clear about which brand you're getting . Carparts4less work out about the same as ECP so I don't see the point . Edited by PositronicRay on Wednesday 25th November 1747

2f55707d4193dc27118a0f19a1985716	no	1st of all ... a lot of negative trolls on here . I have only posted a few times and only truthfully and with no malice towards Uber drivers . The few bc posts on here stating that business is still good ... I'm sorry trolls ... are correct . The reasons for this are simple . 60% of cabbies are over 55 . A lot of the older guys have given up the trade mainly because of TFL treachery and the older cabbies failure to adept to technology .( 30% of my work is now Hailo & Gett ) Also .. it is completely changed since the 80's 90's when they worked 9-5pm for ¬£250 . So less cabs in town . No more pissheads/ cokeheads/ ar#eholes Sorry trolls but since Uber I honestly have had zero customers getting sick . Zero ... not one . 3 years ago it was 2 a month . U guys got all the cheapskates . Thank you Uber . Ubers competition has raised the bar . Most cabs WILL now go south or anywhere else .( miserable old cabbies retired ) Even saw a cabbie with a tie on yesterday . Credit cards gonna be in all cabs by October .( About bl ...

7380ad8a673226ae47fce7bff88e9c33	yes	Well , my first time on this mode I use A . Amber with just lv . 15 and that I got some of bad word too . The gear you use and the roll of how your character can do in game also importance . Since I usually play heal/sub character likes Amber/A . Amber and Wanta that mean I can't deal damage that much compare to other character but they are good at support your team . Wanta is my fav character now due to her skill that if you can manage a good use they will help your team a lot like 1st skill when you up in 2nd in game with will share the damage you get together , If you use at a good timing this will not just heal your team but also share a damage you receive , for example a ram with red bar cause damage 1000 when it rush you and 2 time you gone for good but if you manage to use skill just before get attack the damage you receive will get less . her 2nd and 3rd skill also useful when you encounter with many enemy , you can use it to help your team or escape from them to make opportunity for other player to deal with them one thing that I always found when I play healer/sub is other players won't play safe that much that they thing they can heal anytime and when they die they do blame healer first TwT if you not play healer/sub characters type , remember that they won't damage that much and can't heal you anytime you want . just be more careful and you will be fine when you play heroic mode with sub/healer

But I'm picturing my Veletri cassette just under my skin ... and a big square popping out ...?!) How big is the pump they put inside you ? Do they just stick it into your stomach ? Is it uncomfortable sitting , etc ? Can you see it ? Sorry for the silly questions , just hoping it's approved for general use soon and want to know more in hopes of swimming with my kids someday ...
3cf166c6b73f030b4f67eeaeba301103	no	Hi +christian murgatroyd , At present , the security on NFC chips in the phones isn't considered secure enough . This is why we're using the physical tags and ( for those who qualify ) the NFC SIM's . As the tech matures though , it's possible that the NFC feature on your phone will replace these . At present , the NFC capability on your phone will still be handy for data sharing or wireless connectivity to accessories ( such as audio speakers ). Cheers , Ben
cee631121c2ec9232f3a2f028ad5c89b	yes	I'm very lucky to be able to take antibiotics , its the steroids that mess with my head dizziness , feeling like I was going to pass out stuff like that .

e2230b853516e7b05d79744fbd4c9c13	no	Yeah there are a lot of abused ED30s out there . In my experience , excessive interior rattling in Golfs is usually always as a result of previous owners dicking about with it . Like fitting aftermarket ICE , repairing window regulators and A/C faults and not replacing broken clips etc etc . Having said that , you can't expect silence over bumps in a stiffly sprung hot hatch running 18"" wheels that's got some years and miles under it's belt .

0fcbc61acd0479dc77e3cccc0f5ffca7	yes	I agree with Michelle , I was taken off mtx bc of the massive hair loss , and liver damage , even with folic acid and reducing my dose 2x . Being female makes you have a higher risk for dry eyes , then the inflammation from RA as well . You will notice your vision crisp up ( even with 20x20 ) when you use drops to ease the inflammation . RA can attack your eyes so be careful . Get them checked by an eye Dr regularly .

33e8075e9970de0cfea955afd4644bb2	no	We've been using this app for several months now and have found it very user-friendly and convenient both for staff , and for customers choosing to pay by checking-in to our store or paying by card . Faster than cash or regular card transactions ! Requires very little staff training - a few minutes really . Customers are impressed with the technology and always comment on it which is great for us as it's more customer interaction and allows us to deliver a more personal service . Best of all we didn't have to make any changes to our existing tills . Would highly recommend it to anyone considering adding it to their POS systems !

5ea1649a31336092c05438df996a3e59	no	No , QA would not find it . The benchmark is ""Pass the emission test"". And passing the test it did . The QA benchmark was not ""perform unneeded and expensive live road emission tests"". BUT , all engineers and managers involved in the engine development and product integration and development knew to 100% that that engine was a stinker and could not pass the US emission tests . It is suspicious that EXACTLY at that time when the engine was nearing the decision for deployment , suddenly an entire level of top-notch development managers all involved with the development of that engine and its product integration left VAG .

7f24d240521d99071c93af3917215ef7	no	Having endured multiple side effects from Anfatinib 40gms , I suppose the good news is that one nodule appears to have vanished but I had to stop taking it last week and todaysaw the Oncologist , who originally assured me that I am ""the boss"" and he clearly had a Plan in mind , although he never seems to be quite up to date with Histology results , X-rays and the like and needs reminders . He conceded that there are other drugs available but really wanted to reduce my dose of Anfatinib to 30gms .

5e388103a391daabe3de1d76a6739ccd	no	Hi . I've bring a Skoda octavia tour 2 2012 from EU . The dashboard odometer indicates just in km/h and to be able to registered here need to be mixt or mph . Skoda garage said they can't recode this dashboard , and to change the dashboard with one in mph is costing me around ¬£1100 . Also they are not sure if the UK lefthand drive will match . Any ideas how to do it cheaper ?

a9a6653e48976138166de32772b1bf40	yes	I've repaired similar lever controls . I have found the easiest solution is to make sure the shaft fitting is flat sided and square (or close ). Use a hand file . Then ""peen"" the level square hole to shrink the size of the hole . I use a hardened round chisel and a vise to peen the metal . It takes a few times until its tight . Then put the nut back on with a star toothed lock washer . No need to remove the trans .Ôªø
58ae749f25eded36f486bc85feb3f0ab	no	After 2-1/2months on not having any clue what was wrong with me , I was diagnosed with bilateral PE in October . In 2008 I was diagnosed with diastolic dsyfunction and my doctor felt I had pulmonary hypertension , but it was never confirmed . I just spent a week in the hospital thinking I had another clot ; however , they ruled that out based on a VQ scan . The ECHO was not conclusive so they did a right and left heart cath . And stated I have ""mild"" pulmonary hypertension . In October , it was severe and showed on the ECHO . Question ... lots of them ? Can you have the same symptoms as I did with the PE ? I am short of breath with much exertion and my heart goes from 68 to 110 just putting on my clothes . And I get pain in my chest . This morning I went out to get a few groceries and I am back and feel horrible . But let me add it was about 100 degrees already when I was out . Is heart hard on the lungs and heart ? My pulmonologist office told me to ""chill"" until I see the doctor on Friday . Posted on 06/17/12 , 0327 pm

dd458505749b2941217ddd59394240e8	yes	I am also concerned about the amount of randomness as well as the camera . If they would implement the fog of war mechanic this would be a fix , it also adds a lot of interesting possibilities for characters , items , maps and more . The randomness really hurts in scavenger , especially the ones which rely on you doing something that does not happen too often . For example , survival adaptation gives you a 33% chance to survive and become invisible when receiving a fatal blow , then it gets put on a cooldown . I would suggest for these kinds of perks to remove the random element and increase the cd if it would turn out to be too op .

f0e52b27a7a5d6a1a87373dffa53dbe5	no	Thank you for your patience , something I sometimes lack ; i have a ROKU . I have a PC , W7pro with 4GB DDR3 and a nVidia 750 Ti , on a Netgear 1GB router , to which my Roku is also hardwired . I install the server and reboot . At startup my Firefox browser displays the PLEX page and says it's not running ( image below ). If I go to my tray it is running and available ( image below ) If I go to the Roku , plex says it sees nothing ; if I run the Roku media manager , it sees the PLEX server and all the content . So I don't understand Why is PLEX not seeing itself if other software can ? Why does it boot not working , but is in fact running ? here are 2 shots Thanks !

fde9264cf376fffe2ee4ddf4a988880d	no	On Windows , you get the SpotifyWebHelper . exe loaded , no matter what . It always creates an entry in the startup list and loads in the background , regardless of the client's setting on auto-loading being at 'no'. Once you run Spotify , you get the startup back . Since I'm using another client ( Fidelify ) I can safely state that this sort of 'helper' application isn't needed , especially not when the user sets it to off and/or doesn't even start the service . I don't like it when programs disregard their own settings and force-load modules without notice and need . Why not start and end services with the main application ? Current rough workaround delete (or better rename ) the exe , Spotify works like before . If it doesn't , just revert back . I wrote about the significant RAM impact before . For just playing some music , most likely while you are using some 'main' applications , 400mb or more aren't justifiable in principle . This becomes even more obvious when looking at how many features got lost with updating . So there's no automatic volume adjustment , same as there are no apps running within the client or simple search/navigate features . Again , the most striking comparison can be made when firing up a basic Spotify client ( mentioned above ) and looking how responsive the UI and streaming presents itself , with not even using 60mb , while offering search filters . On a side note , one does not get the ASIO/WASAPI audio interface with Spotify , while the smaller and leaner client offers it . Once you've heard the difference , this lack , especially for premium users ( HQ streaming ), becomes quite apparent in the sense of wondering why a music service is avoiding the better sound output while already streaming the necessary file sizes . On another occasion , one could define and set the cache location and size . Now you can't . While you still can't pick where to actually install the Spotify client ( it grabs AppDataRoamingSpotify on Windows , no matter what ), it now caches and uses that same location which isn't what some SSD users might have planned for their precious free space . Those music files do not benefit from any SSD speeds . Thanks for keeping track of all the losses coming with the new client in the threads like these . With every day adding to the life of the new and reduced client , it seems harder to stick with the otherwise fine service . I actually like the Android client ( and sound ) a lot more than the current Windows software .

As an ex-Leica user I'm aware that , once you get past the massive hyperbole surrounding the brand , the cameras and lenses are good but no better than the offerings from other manufacturers at much lower prices . John Griffith's more balanced codicil on the realities of ownership is an order of magnitude more helpful than the original .

30bb3825e8f631cc6075c0f87bb4978c	no	Hi Raiders wife and welcome to DS . So sorry you are in so much pain and without a diagnosis . The liver tests are to allow them to know what your liver function is before they place you on meds , but I would think you would be started on something to help you out a bit until the results of the test came back which is usually 1-3 days . Hopefully you will have an answer and some pain relief soon . I was like Jess , RA was picked up right away by the primary MD with my symptoms alone and I was able to get treatment started quickly . Good thing as RA has progressed quickly in me as well . And if things don't work out with one Rheumatologist as Jess said I would move on to another . ( which I have done in the past . Good luck to you .

dbe272bab69f8e13f14b405e038deb64	no	Just a profile created with the X-Rite Color Checker Passport and the X-Rite software . Two shots of the test card outdoor daylight shade and indoor under tungsten light . I've done the same for my M9 and M240 . TBH , it makes much less of a difference with the SL than it did with the M9 , and less than the M240 . It helps a bit with what I see as over-saturated reds , but these are personal judgements . My profile also removes a bit of cyan from the sky . I think the Adobe Standard profile over-corrects the embedded profile's yellow-green grass to excessively blue-green grass (or perhaps it's the other way round ), but I get a bit OCD with grass green ! Colour profiles are personal things .

They can't be sued for just that . Nothing illegal about it . But forcing Google Mail , Google Maps , etc . to be pre-installed IS abusing the monopoly power over operating systems to gain marketshare in the Maps and Mail spaces . Google simply has to not pre-install those , but allow those to be downloaded separately and they comply .

abd815286ba1007abfbb8415b83ae2cf	no	Thanks burnerman . The gears select no problem with the engine off . I'd actually just been out having a look at it . I traced the clutch cable from the pedal through the firewall and discovered a cone shaped object with fins midway along the clutch cable casing which should have been clipped into a plastic housing attached to the firewall ( any idea what this is ?). For some reason it had slipped out of this clip and reduced the tension in the cable so I guess the clutch wasn't engaging fully . I've clipped this back in and it's definitely improved - the pedal feels more positive and most gear changes are easier . However , it's still stiff changing into first - and still crunches slightly when selecting reverse , but it's been doing that for while anyway . My best ( uninformed ) guess is that the clutch is still not engaging fully so I'm wondering whether it's worth adjusting the clutch cable or whether it needs a visit to the expensive private doctors at the Volkswagen Infirmary for a new clutch ? Any thoughts ?

4ffce04d92a4d6cb21c1494cdfcd6dc1	yes	Hi Patty , I hate to say it but I don't consider that I have angry days now , I did in the beginning where I refused to give in , pushed myself too far and wouldn't take help from anyone . I hated the fact that my family could go overseas and I couldn't any more but I had to pull myself out of that and get on with what I could do , not easy either . I suppose being diagnosed at 54 was a bit of an advantage and the fact that I had a son that was in his last year of school so no little kids to worry about . I'm on O2 24/7 and yes it gets to me at times but it has taken me years to learn to live with it and do what I can . It does you good to come here and vent and express your feelings to those who understand . There are also some good PH facebook groups too . The one thing I have learnt is to ask for help when you need it , either advice here or information or simple things like help with the house work - don't be afraid to ask . It took me 4 years to ask just to have my house cleaned . Use the services you are eligible for at every opportunity so you can enjoy your children and the things you can do . Give it time and remember we are here to support you always . Aussie Joan

I'm ok with meeting my maker right this second so death is no threat to me . Personally I think the Lord makes this disease suck so bad so that we are more than happy to go see Him , but I'm not rushing him yet I'd settle for a bandaid and another 20 years here with my family !

And ask them to call the PH doctor on-call . In the meantime is there a pattern of activity causing this ? Are you getting overheated ? Climbing stairs ?

He is also going to arrange a full body scan from head to toe so at least I know what is going on . As its his consultant that's asked for bloods to be taken he will go but he isn't happy about the scan . He just said 'why do I want to be told I'm a step closer to dying'. I hate hearing him say those sort of things . Thinking of you all .

2dea61eed4bceec564a00115c4d21334	no	Matic might not be the most exciting name but he'll be the most important and effective signing for us . Pogba and Herrera will thrive with Matic behind them . He did the silent job last season Kante got all the plaudets but Matic was great . When Jose went back in his 2nd season to Chelsea Matic was head & shoulders above every CDM in the league when they won the league in 2015

0d7de1aca9299fe63f3e0041f02638a3	no	It's dependent on the iPhone because it has to be . The technology isn't there to have a full suite of radios powered up with enough processing to do all the processing on the watch . This thing probably has no more than about a 300mA battery . The iPhone 5S battery is a bit more than five times that size . If you want the watch to do most of what the phone does , you're looking at 20% of the battery life . Probably a bit more because the smaller screen sucks less power , but the radios will have much smaller antennae as well , so you'll need to increase the gain on the cellular , wifi , GPS , bluetooth , etc . No one wants a watch that does everything your phone does , but only for four hours .

dc6a70712a252123c40d2adba6a11d84	yes	You could maybe give Living Proof Curl detangling rinse a try . On wash day I use a gentle cleanser then apply my conditioner without any detangling . I just smooth and scrunch the conditioner through . Then I rinse and apply the L .P . detangler . The stuff is amazing , super slippy , I can go straight to using my Denman without really bothering using my fingers . Then I just rinse it out and it leaves my hair so silky , ready for some LI . And I lose less hair too . The downside is the price as its expensive , but you only use a small amount and it smells lovely .

08d98638c6fcd194a4b1e6992063e944	yes	First , welcome to out site , we are glad to have you here . Second we are not medically trained unless the writer says so , so take our advice with a large spoon full of caution . Your high blood pressure needs to be treated less your kidneys fail or you have a stroke or heart attack . Please see a doctor soon as that is a real problem .Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension , PAH , is a disease of high blood pressure in the arterial chamber between the right ventricle of the heart and the lung . From all I have read and been told and experienced personally , high body blood pressure has no relationship to PAH . That is one or the other can be high and the other low . Or they can both be high or both low . This is not a disease that you want as there is no cure . The only way to absolutely diagnose it is to use a catheter and directly measure the pressure in the arterial chamber . Then if its over 25 or so , you have PAH by definition . It is a rare disease and it is a high probability as a doctor if you tell someone they don't have it you are right . It is not a disease where you want to say that you do have it unless you have made the measurement . Even an electrocardiogram is only an estimate of yes or no you have it . So Don't stress so much if at all possible . Get your BP under control and then if you are still anxious see a GP and get a pill or two and laugh and be happy . No worthwhile doctor is going to subject you to a heart catherization unless there is every possibility that you do have a problem there . God have mercy on us allKeep in touch and let us hear from you . Best regardsCicero

From what I understand , Android keeps a cached list of all the media files ( including playlists ) which is updated by the media scanner . Is that correct ? I'll avoid doubletwist from now on , but I don't think syncing is really my problem . My problem is that android still thinks my old m3u files are there and won't check to see if they've been deleted ...

I proceeded with the normal dosage this week , so far ( 2 ) on Monday and ( 2 ) on Wednesday .. Well I'm guessing that is bringing the herx back because my one shoulder is the most pain I've ever felt in it ( usually doesn't give me problems ).. You know that bone that short sticks out up on your shoulder ? Well on my left side that bone is a little bigger than on the right and it is oh SOOO tender .. Possible herx symptom ?? ( I hope )..

b056eb1587586b71e2da9acfe4fbd19e	no	Hello all Just a quick update . Mum had a biopsy today but wasn't of her lungs she's still not had one of those . This one was of an enlarged node in her neck . The area around her neck is swollen . Tbikes took 2 viles of liquid from her neck area which seemed to drain the swelling a bit . The doctor doing the biopsy apparently said level 5 and also mentioned something was pressing on her jugular . He also mentioned hashimotos disease . Not sure if that has anything to do with her type 1 diabetes ? Her appointment with the doctor is weds so hopefully her cut scan and biopsy results will be more clear . I just hooe they dont say its spread to her collar bone lymph node . Iv read thats latestage . Much love to everyone

959a557f5f6beb411fd954f3f34b21c3	no	I was trying to listen to the Chiefs home opener on 101 the Fox Suday . I too had MMS links . Could not get them to work at all on my MyTouch .

86b122d4358357d834a87ce618a55de0	no	There was a time that watching apple keynotes were so exciting ... I mean they used to show so many new and innovative things . when they announced ipod nano ... WOW , or MacBook Air ... WOW ... or iPhone , iPAD ... there always was something that you were eager to get your hands on ...! I still remember the feeling when they first announced MacBook Air ... man ... there were the times of excitement ... But now ... I watched the entire keynote ... there is nothing exiting there ... iPhones are just blown up versions of what they already have ( and the guy says the display ""is packed with incredible innovations"" and people cheer when they announce the new iPhone 6 is only 6 . 9 millimeter tick ! ( btw there are smartphones only 5 . 5mm thick !)) ... even Watch is not something I want to have ... there are more innovative and exciting products out there already ... I'm sure they'll be selling iPhones and Watches like hotcakes but that's not the point ! Apple is not exciting anymore ... there is no innovation ... there is no genius left ... and that's such a pity for a company once so many people looked up to ... such a pity ...Ôªø

7143d7fbadfa4693b9eec507d9d37443	no	Hi all . I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis a little over a year ago at the age of 40 . Since I also have Fibromyalgia ( since 1993 ) and Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome , I now have three conditions that can cause fatigue . Along with the fatigue , I experience ""brain fog"" which is making it very difficult to perform my job functions as a teacher . The Dr gave me Provigil to help get me through the day , but I don't see this as a very good answer , nor do I like taking such meds . Does anyone here have both RA and Fibromyalgia ? If so , how have you treated it ? Brain fog - How have people dealt with this ? Thanks !

96b9bff013acedfb1d140579e2fbeb63	yes	I wish you luck with Humira ! As a warning though , I was on Humira (on and off as I was fighting infections ) for two years . One day , I noticed my vision becoming blurry , but chaulked it up to fatigue . Needless to say , it got worse , very fast . I was fortunate to think of Humira and side effects ; turns out , blindness is a side effect . My RA doc instantly had me stop ( I actually already did ) and my vision has returned , just not completely . I'm hoping the blurred vision ( it's not constant ) will go away . Just know , pay attention to ANY changes . Read what the side effects are . I was also on prednisone which , taken with humira , can increase mood swings . Let me tell you , my family deserves a medal for putting up with me ! As with any RA meds , the side effects are the scary part . Be careful and pay attention to what your body is doing . Good luck !
71ad16ad2c4d81f348082ff6c4b20768	no	Having just watched the grilling on CNBC that Congress gave to Michael Horn , US CEO of VW , I would think he might go home and shoot himself . A brilliant cross-examination and just what democracy should be about . He was left in no doubt that all the blame could not be laid on a couple of rogue engineers . One congressman suggested that VW should not just put aside $6 . 8 bn but $68 bn , and I think he would be capable of justifying that figure .

7250eb93b3c18cc9daa29cf58af7a004	no	NOx is an inherent problem with diesels . the converters/reducers wont work with diesels because they have too much NOx for a reducer like you have in a gas car can handle . instead they use a urea injection , affectionately know by truck drivers as a piss tank . they dont have the monoxide output of the older cars but oxides of nitrogen ( NOx ) is a problem . 78% of the air we breathe is nitrogen and when teperatures go above 1500 degrees , the nitrogen begins to bind with oxygen rather than just going out the tailpipe .

02a32ad2669e6fe298e607fe7cc0e1a0	yes	Did the engineers get a couple of extra bucks for writing the cheat code that's going to cost Volkswagen $100 billion dollars ? Exactly what incentive does the engineers have to do this ? You tell the management what they want is impossible and you design what's best . This is total horseshit . They need to send an independent team in there because you can't trust these people . And here they are throwing the workers under the bus .

e97ee2054defb209c35fe4dc94599061	no	I have the exact same problem on my Android TV . The movie freezes at some point and then the subtitles are off-sync . The only way to fix is restart the movie . The subtitles are fine up to the point where the movie froze for the first time . This is really annoying since the subtitles are very important because we live in a building where we cannot make a lot of noise . Is there anything we can do to help solving the issue ? Also , watching a movie in the android tv not always refreshes the playback status . For example , I watch and stop the movie at minute 50 but for Plex in android tv the movie stopped at minute 30 . Or if I finish watching the movie it shows as not finished in the Plex server .

a67f096809415ca1c9f112d96d27689b	no	In a large corporation it‚Äôs not wise to ‚Äúgo rogue‚Äù and do something that hasn‚Äôt been approved by senior management . A great example of that is Luc Donkerwolke , former Bentley design chief who called out Lincoln in social media and accused them of copying Bentley when they designed the new Lincoln Continental . It wasn‚Äôt too much longer before he was out the door . And this was a guy who was reportedly in line to become the next VW Group design head . If I were an upper level engineer with Ford and I discovered VW was cheating , I‚Äôd notify my superiors and go on about my job .

dd45045f8c68db9f54e70c67048d32e8	yes	I think you can see we all know what you mean . All I think and pray about is my father's lung cancer . But , the weekend of the 30th I did go away with my hubby and daughters . It had been planned from way before the diagnosis . I felt GUILTY about going , but I couldnt let my daughters down . Also , I know my father would feel bad about me cancelling plans . He doesnt want this to monopolize everyone's life . So , it did ease the guilt a lot knowing that . Having said that , I do put a lot of other things on the back burner ( hubby included ), because sometimes I just dont know what to do or feel that my father needs me the most right now . But you asked for advice . Go with hubby . Dad will be fine . It sounds like you are a wonderful daughter .
49c9adb18e44be0711a94e827042f630	no	@PineappleUnderTheSea @DSpengler You are somewhat correct in that consumers expect the goodies that Google provides , but that doesn't make Google as bad as Apple . Google willingly provides android to anyone who wants it , source code and all , via ASOP . Google is under no obligation to do this , they could make Android as closed sourced as iOS or Windows , and honestly if I were Google , and I lost this EU case , I would just stop open sourcing it entirely out of spite . No more custom ROMs , no more custom skins , no more manufacturer customizations . That would make it the same as iOS and Windows thus , logically any action against Google would be taken against Apple and Microsoft at that point . That said ...Personally , I wouldn't mind it if Google separated out the Play store from their suite of other apps . I really don't need google plus on my phone sitting there wasting space . However , angering Google could backfire in a major way , not that I think google would pursue the course of action I described , as ""Be Together , Not the Same"" is one of the major selling points of Android . The EU and the manufacturers are biting the hand that feeds them here hopefully , they won't come to regret it .

704afe073992cbe4813cae2f7715336f	yes	For a diesel , the start is the hard bit ! Because compression ignition engines rely on the heat of compression to initiate combustion , they can be quite picky about starting ! The ""heat"" bit comes from the compression , so leaky rings , slow cranking or incorrect valve timing all can reduce that bitThe ""fuel"" bit requires nicely atomised fuel in the correct quantities . Large droplets of fuel , caused by low rail pressure at start or worn injector nozzles , are difficult to heat up , and tend to stick to the cold walls of the cylinder . And worse , if the cylinder fails to fire on the first few turns , the injector keeps on pumping in more fuel , which cools the cylinder even more , making it even less likely to fire ! And when it does , all the liquid diesel gets chucked out into the exhaust and burnt at low pressure and temperaure , effectively creating a smoke screen out back ! So , here are the test you need to do BEFORE you spend any money changing stuff1 ) Check glow plugs - done ! 2 ) Check it cranks at a decent speed ( no knackered battery or stater motor ) 3 ) Do a cold cranking compression test4 ) Log , ideally using an OBD tool , the fuel rail pressure prior to , during , and after a start event . You could also use a multimeter to read the pressure sensor output , but it's not ideal , as you want to see pressure vs engine speed . ( worn HP pumps are less efective at low speed , leading to low rail pressures at cranking ) 5 ) If that all looks normal , out with the injectors and get them tested and re-conditionedMost people , just throw a new set of injectors at the problem BEFORE they work out what is actually wrong with it , It could be as simple as a failing rail pressure sensor or lift pump ...

cfbce4c1d7c425baf21d6b6f2babe6be	no	Why is #10 and #12 a thing ? Each service has some music that the other service doesn't have and vice versa . When it comes to an extra app , i have to infest my Windows PCs with iTunes to listen to Apple Music , when the Android app is released , they do also have to install an app . Regardless , I don't really see this as a thing to bring up when comparing these two services . While testing Apple Music on my iPhone , I noticed that it was better integrated with the lock screen compared to Spotify . I've also noticed some bugs on the lockscreen with Spotify that I have yet to experience with Apple Music , such as music appearing to be playing on the screen while it is actually paused if I pause with my earbuds . There is still no way to migrate your playlists from Spotify to Apple Music , but it is possible the other way around . Although I've been using Spotify for about six years , I can't remember experiencing the same confusion as when I started with Apple Music ( And iTunes on my PC ). Despite having a good reputation for good UX , Apple Music is an entire mess compared to Spotify . There are just too may options and things going on , where I personally feel that Spotify is far more organized as they are focusing more on one single thing . I have also yet to find any option to what music quality I want it to stream and whether to allow it to stream through cellular , which was a big thing with Apple in order to allow Spotify out on the app store .
c2aee86157b4a40b78132f1e71a9e6f1	no	If it were anything less than it is then it would be ""not fit for purpose intended"". But it's fine . If it were any heavier it would need a strap - mostly because of that huge battery - but it doesn't quite . I can't find any reason why it needs the speed control , full blast is just about adequate for everything ; including removing leaves from my bedding area that has bark down as a mulch . The blower moves the leaves , but not the bark . It won't shift the last 5% of the leaves off the lawn , leaves a few hanging around no matter how hard I blowIt's not that quiet either - 92dB so about the same as our petrol Rotavator but not quite as load as the mower .Once the pile of leaves gets to about 2"" think it again struggles to move them - but by that stage you can pick them up . Not a problem for a small garden - might get tiresome if you have a lot of trees shedding a lot of leaves . To give some effort reference For my main ( about 6m*40m ) garden took me about 20 minutes to tidy up . This was with leaves that had been there for a few weeks , and had rotted down somewhat so were wet and slightly sticky and also the chickens had got in there so there was chicken poo making it harder as well . Hopefully the next time it will be quicker .

cbb6a3b884f4f88b3a8e3d44c636cbd8	no	The blood transfusion really did the trick . I think he's feeling better after his second chemo than he did after the first ! It's hard not getting frustrated lately though , especially when I read about cancer things online . I wish I'd done it earlier but I'm not sure it would've helped . It's just so outrageous to me that a patient who'd had lung cancer , despite them being declared NED for a while , would be denied an MRI when they started complaining of headaches and dizziness/vertigo . They started at ... the end of January , start of February . I think mid Feb our family doctor tries to get him an MRI and the insurance company says no because she ""didn't give a good enough reason"". But between then and when he had a small seizure in May , none of the doctors who were part of his earlier cancer team when he was 1a thought much about his headaches . Gave him antibiotics because they thought it was allergies . Ugh . I realize foresight is in play here but ... still . How did his doctors let him go three months with painful headaches and a host of other problems ( slight vision issues , slight dizziness , etc ) without trying harder to convince the insurance company he needed an MRI ? Well , to be fair to his oncologist , she was finally the doctor who at least tried to get him an MRI . We were just unlucky that he had his episode two days before the scheduled test !
1f4477bad7af3616c1f933a02bfabe4e	no	I'm not sure whether it's possible that they can upgrade the GPU enough to allow a theoretical PS4K to play all PS4 games in native 4K , but some thoughts that give me a glimmer of hope are1 . They might be able to alter the mix of GPU resources to heavily emphasize pixel processing while leaving the number of polygons , detail of textures , and instructions that can be decoded the same . 2 . They might leave the CPU power and design exactly the same , just scaling it down , and use all the die space on the chip that opens up for GPU resources . 3 . They could switch from GDDR to HBM for a bandwidth boost . This may just be wishful thinking , though . Hopefully we'll get a better idea of what might be possible when AMD or Nvidia announce their first scaled down PC GPUs . I'm afraid that what will really happen is that games will be rendered at ~3K and then upscaled to 4K .

Especially if your dad is tolerating docetaxel which has got to be one of the most toxic chemos there are . Also try and speak to the oncologist at the marsden who said to keep going while its working .Phone his secretary you will get through via the switchboard if you don't have a number . Just ask them to explain why and if you don't understand keep asking them to explain until you are satisfied with the answers . Ask your dad if its ok with him or if its not would he like to leave the room while you ask ? I only know you will not want to be left with what ifs and if onlys . Best wishes and good luck . Julie x

To cut a very long ( two months ) story short , mum has been in hospital 3 times since Feb , she has haemorrhaged and is now living with us . She has tumours in both lungs , womb secondary tumour , and now brain secondary tumour , she is exhausted , confused , thin , and I feel I have lost the mum I knew , she is my best friend and I am devastated . I care for her every day , she can just get up out of bed , and walk to the lounge and she is exhausted . The doctors have said she is in the 'weeks to live' category , as opposed to months or days . She gets worse every week . Today , she walked into the lounge and hit the floor . A complete blackout , is this normal with a brain tumour ? Every day is sad , sad to see her look like she does , and sad because she is no longer able to do so many things . She has talked about her funeral , her belongings , and her wishes . It breaks my heart . Can anyone tell me their experiences of secondary lung cancer in the brain . I am frightened she will lose all faculties and not be able to communicate . This cancer has gone on for almost 5 years now , and every year something more devastating happens . Hospitals have now said make her comfortable at home , they cannot do anything for her , my doctors have said they are on the end of the phone if I need them , the district nurses call in every week , and keep telling me to let them help , she doesnt want them to , she wants me to do every thing , it is so tiring for me as I am disabled with arthritis , and the stress is making the arthritis worse . I feel the doctors and district nurses think its me being independant , but it isnt , its mum she doesnt want people around her , only me , my husband and my son . My heart goes out to any of you in the same situation , its upsetting , tiring , and very very sad . Ronnie xx

168908dd3227b8358eababa07fcaf091	yes	Welcome to the forum piratesleeve but sorry to hear of your dads diagnosis . I have never heard of tumors growing from chemo other than growth caused from the chemo not being successful in reducing its size . Without knowing the primary , can become very tricky in treating the cancer as there are different protocols for each specific type . As far as the progression and how long , this question is impossible to answer . Many factors contribute like type , overall health , age , response to treatment etc . The one thing we all can be sure of it the unpredictably off it all . The best thing to do is push the doctors to clarify some of your questions . Write all your questions down and have them readily available when meeting with the oncologist this way , you won't forget them at the appointment . Even though it is an unknown primary , we are always willing and able to help quide you through this journey . Again , sorry your dad is faced with this diagnosis . Cherish each moment with him as I know you are already doing . Stay strong , Lisa

Sony isn't just going to release a console with upgraded specs just like Microsoft won't release an XB1 . 5 . It will be some sort of slim version with 4k capabilities . I could care less about 4k and neither console will be able to output 4K native resolution . This is an option for those who have and want the $$$ to spend on it . How it will alienate others I don't know .

Many of the people continue to see the ''true colors'' of Apple when he was alive with him . In fact , they're overall pretty cool people . Very diverse and creative people , just like any of us could be . When it comes to the big suited men and other corporations wheeling and dealing with them , it becomes a bit negative .

cc1aa436277138f61cda703991069eaf	no	I was wondering about this myself ... Since I use Bettercut , I have all my icons in one folder on the root section of the sdcard ... You can also use Astro File Manager to get to anything and I think when you go to add a shortcut , you are given the choice to browse for a custom icon with Astro or bettercut ... Its probably the same process with wallpapers ...
2ab56412b1163ee131e1246da0955bd1	yes	Why is it that they are still reluctant to say its asthma if a child is under 5 ? When so many children are on ventilators , with breathing difficulties . Once in hospital they call it asthma seeing this poor little mite says everything . Never hesitate just call an ambulance . X
c32d9bf27a3da7ec8163957080c8628e	yes	Glad you found us Lisa ! My experience is that sometimes symptoms and function is better than at other times . I'm fortunate that Tracleer and Adcirca have stabilized and improved my function considerably . Last Fall , an RHC showed my mPAP was normal at rest and behaved normally during exertion . That's ten years after diagnosis , but only 6 years with the right treatment for PAH . Other medical things are much more challenging for me currently , but being treated . This is how it is with me , but everyone is different . Sounds like you're starting all these meds kind of quickly . As I'm sure you know , it can be difficult to sort out what med might be causing side effects when several are started at the same time . Most of the time , one medication is introduced and allowed to work its magic , before another is introduced . It can take 3-6 months for the orals to cause optimum improvement . If you don't already have the PH Patients Survival Guide , I'd suggest your order one . The link is below . If you can attend the conference in June in Indianapolis , you would really enjoy it , and learn a tremendous amount in a short time . I'm not going but have in the past . Plus you'll get to meet over 1000 other patients .

9908279ebbf1f9b250ba689db6a0222b	yes	Can you file the stub clean enough to slide the carrier off what remains of the bolt ? Things will be easier if so . I would then clean-up the bolt stub with wirewool/dremel and find someone with a MIG welder and have them weld an M10 or sim nut to the stub . Wind it out immediately while hot - it should come free owing to the welding heat dumped into the stub . I've had broken studs out of more-awkward things ( eg snapped flush with engine block ...) before by this method . If not at first try , hit the migged stub with a torch , try again , - until it comes free .

692f93be8c7a41525c0baf2076aecfb4	no	I am not necessarily talking about various artists . For example , on a particular 2Pac CD , the metadata has ""All Eyez on Me"" for the album and every song on there has 2Pac as the ""Album artist"". Some songs may have something different under the ""artist"" field such as 2Pac feat . Snoop Dogg or 2Pac feat . Nate Dogg , etc . So the problem is on every music player app I have tried on my phone , if you go to the artist list , it is display everything in the artist field rather than the album artist field ( it will not only show 2Pac , but will also show all the other names under the ""artist"" field such as 2Pac feat . Snoop Dog , 2Pac feat . Nate Dogg , etc .) This becomes very cluttered and if you were to just select the 2Pac artist , it would not show all the other songs . To get around this , do I need to edit the metadata so the artist field only says 2Pac ( and get rid of all the feat . other artists ?).
